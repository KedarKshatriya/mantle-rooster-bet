## How it's Made
To build a betting platform based on the game "chicken run" and with live streaming, you would need to use various technologies that are pieced together to create a cohesive platform. Here are the technologies and how they are pieced together to build the platform:

1. Three.js: This JavaScript library was used to generate the "chicken run" game and provide a visually appealing and engaging user experience.

2. Livepeer: This live streaming platform was integrated to provide real-time video and audio streaming capabilities, allowing users to watch the game in action.

3. Mantle Testnet: This blockchain platform provides secure and transparent betting functionality, allowing users to place bets using BIT tokens.

4. Metamask: This was used to provide wallet connectivity and handle transactions, making it easier for users to place bets and manage their BIT tokens.

The integration of these technologies allowed for a seamless and engaging betting experience, with fast and low-cost transactions and blockchain technology's added security and transparency. Three.js provided a visually appealing and attractive game, while Livepeer and Testnet ensured a smooth and reliable betting experience. The integration of Metamask made it easy for users to manage their bets and tokens.

Overall, combining these technologies made for a well-rounded and impressive platform that offers a unique and exciting betting experience.
